mathstats.py is the file with sum, standard deviation and count

I have imported numpy for standard deviation function and used numpy.std which accepts a list and give the output.

primes.py is the file which gives all the primes between 2 and 10000000

I have used chunks of 5000 and sent to the map function. I have first calculated number of palindromes and then calculated whether it
is prime or not.

passCrack.py is the file which cracks the password with the first 5 letters hash
